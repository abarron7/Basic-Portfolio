    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I am a student who works fulltime and also goes to school at night. I enjoy technology and cool gadgets. My
        hobbies are video games, movies, television shows, comic book superheroes, and solving puzzels.
        I have found a great interest in programming and web design. I have always enjoyed meeting new people and also
        working with others. My goal is to someday build a career and start a family whom I can care for and love.
        Mostly I want to lead a simple, yet exciting and fun life! </p>
